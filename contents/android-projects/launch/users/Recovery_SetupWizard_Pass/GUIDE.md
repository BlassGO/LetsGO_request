# 🔐 SetupWizard Pass
> This module supports both Magisk, KSU and derivatives.

## ℹ️ About
- If you don't want to go through all the SetupWizard steps, you can skip them in a quick flash.
- If you accidentally deleted SetupWizard and now the device boots semi-restricted (you can't scroll the notification bar, the lock screen doesn't appear, and more)

## 🔧 Prerequisites
- The pass only works if the device did the first boot. If you performed a factory reset you must reboot and wait for it to boot.

## 🛠️ Instructions
1. Boot into Recovery mode.
2. Install the ZIP.
3. Enjoy
