# Installation

> This module supports both Magisk, KSU and derivatives.

## Instructions
1. Install the module by Magisk/KSU.
2. Wait patiently, the process may take time because it modifies `services.jar`

## REMARK
If you want to include the changes directly in the system (for example for a Custom ROM):

1. Copy the files from `/data/adb/modules/dialog-error-disabler/system` to `/system`
2. Make sure to give the respective credits :)
