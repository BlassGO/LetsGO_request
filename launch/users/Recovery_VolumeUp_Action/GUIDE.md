# üîÑ VolumeUp Action üîÑ
> This module supports both Magisk, KSU and derivatives.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
On each reboot, after the Bootanimation appears:
* You have **7 seconds** to press the **volume-up button** to trigger the action (default: go to Recovery).
* If the button is not pressed, the boot process will simply continue as usual.
* Useful if you anticipate a potential bootloop and your device requires a USB cable to access Recovery (current Samsung devices).

## üîß Prerequisites
1. **Magisk** or **KSU** pre-installed and functional

## üõ†Ô∏è Instructions
1. Install the ZIP by **Recovery**, **Magisk**, or **KSU**.

Installation through Recovery is only compatible with Magisk. KSU and similar necessarily need their Manager.{.remark}

## üõ†Ô∏è ADVANCED
You can customize both the action and the wait time limit.

### Recovery Installations Only
1. Rename the ZIP to change the wait time. For example:
   **Original**
   ```
   VolumeUP_BlassGO[ wait=7 ].zip
   ```
   **Updated (10 seconds)**
   ```
   VolumeUP_BlassGO[ wait=10 ].zip
   ```
1. Install the modified ZIP through Recovery.

This method only applies to Recovery installations, as Magisk/KSU installations typically do not retain the original ZIP name.{.remark}

### Editing the ZIP
To change the configs for all installation methods (including Magisk/KSU):

1. Unzip the ZIP file.
2. Open the `configs.prop` file with a text editor and adjust the properties:
   ```
   # Specify the action
   action=reboot recovery
   
   # Set the wait time in seconds
   timeout=7
   ```

The action must be compatible with the Shell Script environment provided by Magisk/KSU (Busybox){.remark}
