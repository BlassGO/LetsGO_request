# Installation
> This module supports both Magisk, KSU and derivatives.

## About
* Tested on Android 10...14
* You can take screenshots in apps that don't allow it (WhatsApp view once, Chrome in incognito mode, ...)

## Instructions
1. Install the module by Magisk/KSU.
2. Wait patiently, the process may take a while

## For Devs
If you want to include the changes directly in the system (for example for a Custom ROM):

1. **Copy the necessary files:** 
    * Locate the files within the module's system directory: `/data/adb/modules/flag-secure-disabler/system`
    * Copy these files to the corresponding system directories. 

2. **Acknowledge the source:** 
    * Include proper credits and acknowledge the original source of the modifications in your ROM's documentation.
