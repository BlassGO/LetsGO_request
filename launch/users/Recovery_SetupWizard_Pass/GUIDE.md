## When to use it?
- If you don't want to go through all the SetupWizard steps, you can skip them in a quick flash.
- If you accidentally deleted SetupWizard and now the device boots semi-restricted (you can't scroll the notification bar, the lock screen doesn't appear, and more)

## Prerequisites
- The pass only works if the device did the first boot. If you performed a factory reset you must reboot and wait for it to boot.

## Instructions
1. Boot into Recovery mode.
2. Install the ZIP.
3. Enjoy
